# Mod setup

**Before reading this chapter, make sure you have already completed the [project setup](1.%20Project%20Setup.md).**

## Configuring folders.
Since `LethalLevelLoader` (`LLL` for short) is used for mod creation, let's make the mod itself.

In the `Assets/LethalCompany/Mods` folder, create your own next to `plugins`.

Inside this folder, create an `ExtendedMod`. (`Right Click > Create > LethalLevelLoader > ExtendedMod`)

**If you can't find any `LethalLevelLoader` content, try repeating the chapter on [project setup](1.%20Project%20Setup.md) again.**

The following `ScriptableObject` should appear in your folder after creation:

- `Mod Name` field, as you might guess, is responsible for the name of your mod.
- `Author Name` field is the author's name. In my case, it's `Turbotaliz`. 

**Keep in mind that it's better to use the same author name for all your projects ;')**

The arrays with **Extended** content are what we want to add to our mod in the future.

It comes in different types: from custom items and moons to custom vehicles and footprint types on the ground.

After your **ExtendedSomething** is done, you need to put it in the right array to register.

### Project Structure
I'll add this note just for general understanding.

Overall folders layout doesn't really matter, but we'll split the project into bundles:

- `yourmodname.lethalbundle` - for all the necessary mod files, including `ExtendedMod`, `ExtendedLevel`, `SelectableLevel` etc., **EXCLUDING ANY SCENE ASSETS**
- `yourscenename.lethalbundle` - for **SCENE ASSET/S ONLY** (at least for moons)

so you need to keep in mind where everything will be stored, for your own convenience.

Of course the project structure may vary, but i follow this scheme:

```
LethalCompany/
\Game
\Mods
-\plugins [BepInEx pugins]
-\TurbotalizsMoons [Root folder where I store my projects]
--\12Aerona [The Aerona mod itself, one of my planets]
---|>Include [Music and some meshes that I use in the scene]
---|ExtendedLevel, ExtendedMod, etc. [The scene can actually be placed here too]
--\SharedPrefabs [Prefabs I made in advance. Shelves, hangars, ready-made trees, and other decor that I took from other maps. They are not part of the mod itself, only its scene, and can be used in other mods, which is why they're Shared.]
--\BlankReferences [We'll get to this later in the optimizations section]
--\Scenes [Folder for scene assets, but this is optional]
```

This is how I do it, but you can organize the project in a way that's convenient for you personally. I'm just showing how I have my resources distributed.

Starting from here, you can proceed to the next step.
