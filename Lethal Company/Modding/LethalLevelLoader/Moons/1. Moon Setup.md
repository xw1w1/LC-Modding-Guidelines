- `Selectable Level` field is responsible for the selectable level script, we'll deal with him later.

- `Route Price` field is responsible for the cost of flying to the planet (like on `Rend`, `Dine`, etc.).

- `Is Route Hidden` determines whether your planet will be hidden from the terminal list.

- `Is Route Locked` determines whether your planet will be open for visiting at all.

# SelectableLevel.
`SelectableLevel` is, in general, the selectable level itself.

   You can find examples from the game in `Assets/LethalCompany/Game/ScriptableObjects/SelectableLevel/` folder.

   For example, let's choose `AdamanceLevel`. Copy it and paste it into your mod's folder.
