# Project Setup

**Before reading this chapter, make sure you have already completed the [editor setup](https://github.com/xw1w1/LC-Modding-Guidelines/blob/main/en/1.%20Setup.md).**

## DawnLib Unity Package.
After creating the project, you need to download the template for the mod based on `DawnLib`.

Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/TeamXiaolan/DawnLib/releases) and download the `DawnLibTemplate` package with `.unitypackage` extension.

### Import it into Unity

Simply open this file with `UnityEditor` opened. 

Select which type of content you would like to see in your mod and click on `Import`.

You may be asked to confirm the import of assemblies in the format `com.github.teamxiaolan.dawnlib....dll`.

Allow this and wait for the process to complete.

After importing, `DawnLib` item should be visible in the context menu.

Since then you have a ready-to-work `DawnLib` project.
