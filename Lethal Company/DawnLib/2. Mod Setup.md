# Mod setup

**Before reading this chapter, make sure you have already completed the [project setup](https://github.com/xw1w1/LC-Modding-Guidelines/blob/main/Lethal%20Company/DawnLib/1.%20Project%20Setup.md).**

## Configuring folders.
Since `DawnLib` (`DL` for short) provides a beautiful `.unitypackage` you can just use already created layout.

## Creating a Mod.
Inside `.../TemplateMod/` folder, create a new `Mod Information`. (`Right Click > Create > DawnLib > Mod Information`)

**If you can't find any `DawnLib` content, try repeating the chapter on [project setup](https://github.com/xw1w1/LC-Modding-Guidelines/blob/main/en/DawnLib/1.%20Project%20Setup.md) again.**

The following `ScriptableObject` should appear in your folder after creation:

- `Mod Name` field, as you might guess, is responsible for the name of your mod.
- `Author Name` field is the author's name. In my case, it's `Turbotaliz`. 
- `Version` field is your mod's version.

**Keep in mind that it's better to use the same author name for all your projects ;')**

The arrays with **Extra Dependencies** are the Thunderstore packages you need for your mod to work.

Dependency notation strings are formed from `AuthorName` `-` `ModName` `-` `ModVersion`

## Creating a Content Conrainer.

**`Content Container`** is a `Scriptable Object` (a `Unity` assed used to store data) that defines which `AssetBundles` your mod will register.

Your **`ContentContainer`** should list and organize your content (Moons, Items, Enemies, MapObjects, etc.) across different `AssetBundles`.

An `AssetBundle` itself is a file that groups multiple assets together, such as models, textures, prefabs, audio clips, or even entire scenes. `AssetBundles` allow you to package and compress content so it can be loaded in-game.

You can learn more about it in [DawnLib/Docs/ContentContainer](https://github.com/xw1w1/LC-Modding-Guidelines/blob/main/en/DawnLib/Docs/ContentContainer.md).

Starting from here, you can proceed to the next steps.
